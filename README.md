# NU Hacks

NU Hacks is a Northeastern University student group aimed at getting
students involved in development, design, and general hackery. We hold
weekly hacknights and host informational events.

This is our website, which is open source.


## How to contribute

NU Hacks is a club for hackers made by hackers. The same thing is true
of our website. We totally encourage you to fork this repo, make a
change, and submit a pull request.

If you need help, hit up our [Facebook group][fb] or join the #nuhacks
channel on the CCIS IRC.


### Can you code?

Our site is made with Ruby on Rails and we currently deploy to a
Heroku Cedar stack. Check the issues tracker for things that need to
be done, or make a change we haven't thought of yet.


### Can you design?

Want to make our site look better? Found a usability bug? Check out
the app/views or app/assets directories. In true Rails fashion we use
.html.erb for templating and SASS for styling.


### Can you write?

Any block of text you see on the site is free for you to rewrite.


### Can you take photos?

We'd be happy to have a photo of yours as the background for our site!
Here's how to do it:

1. Fork this repo
2. Navigate to the app/assets/images folder
3. Copy your photo into the folder
4. Replace background.jpg with your image (there should be two copies
   of your image in the folder -- one with the original name and one
   named background.jpeg)
5. Submit a pull request

If you're not familiar with steps 1 and 5 (or anything in-between),
feel free to post your image on the [Facebook group][fb].

Things to keep in mind:

1. Make sure you have the rights to the photo (we're really hoping for
   student-submitted original content)
2. Keep it appropriate (the site is our marketing page
   too)
3. Please keep it NEU/Boston themed
